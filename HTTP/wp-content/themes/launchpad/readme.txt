== ABOUT LAUNCHPAD ==

If you're like me, you like registering domains. It's exciting. But what's not exciting is watching your hosting company or domain registrar turn your name into an ad-farm while you're getting ready to launch your next WordPress blog. If you didn't know it, that's called domain parking; a way for hosts and domain registrars to capitalize on all the underdeveloped domains out there. That's why I came up with LaunchPad, the WordPress Domain Parking Theme. To explain: if this theme had a motto it might be, "I'm not your billboard."Now with most hosts offering one-click installs of WordPress, it couldn't be easier to park your domain in style while you get your future blog ready. Just install WordPress, sign up for FeedBurner with email subscriptions (see instructions below) and you're set! You get a professionally designed domain parking page—for free—that serves up an RSS feed link and a form for email updates.
