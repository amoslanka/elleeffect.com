== ABOUT MNML ==

Auttomatic, the company behind WordPress.com have a great quote on their company site, "Blogging is too hard." I totally agree.Why did you start your personal blog anyway? You wanted a place online to share things you found interesting and occasionally write a longer article, maybe even a rant. Right? Did you want to start a magazine site with 40 categories carefully arranged on a complicated home page? Or did you want a blindingly shiny site that looked like it had been attacked by a pack of floor buffers? Probably not. Did you want something simple and cool looking? Something easy to post too? Something that looked, and worked like the tumblelog-style WordPress theme MNML?

MNML features:

* Quick Posting section for logged in users
* An unusual and striking design
* Progressive enhancement for modern browsers
* Search-Engine optimized code

MNML makes use of The Sandbox theme for WordPress (http://code.google.com/p/sandbox-theme/)
