NextGEN Gallery is a full integrated Image Gallery plugin for WordPress with dozens of options and features.

== Description ==

NextGEN Gallery is a full integrated Image Gallery plugin for WordPress with a slideshow option. Before I started writing the plugin I studied all the existing image and gallery plugins for WordPress. 
Some of them are really good and well designed, but the gap I filled was a simple administration system at the back end which can also handle multiple galleries.
